# Data model & migration notes

## Records — `localStorage["modern_work_hours_tracker_v1"]`

A JSON array. Each record:

```jsonc
{
  "id": "string",              // stable unique id
  "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "start": "HH:MM",            // 24-hour
  "cycle": "string",           // LEGACY ONLY — see "Pay cycles" below
  "workingMinutes": 142,       // whole minutes — e.g. 2h22m is stored as 142, not 2.22
  "mapNumber": "string",
  "dayType": "string",         // one of settings.dayTypes[].label at time of entry
  "paymentType": "string",     // one of settings.paymentTypes[].label at time of entry
  "paymentAmount": 60,         // number
  "notes": "string"
}
```

**Backward compatibility:** an even older record shape stored duration as
a decimal `workingHours` field (e.g. `2.5` for 2h30m) instead of
`workingMinutes`. `calculations.js#recordMinutes()` and
`storage.js#loadRecords()` read either shape transparently — a record is
never rewritten just to "normalize" it, so nothing is lost or altered by
opening the app.

## Pay cycles (automatic)

Records no longer carry a manually-typed cycle. Instead, every record's
pay cycle is *calculated* from its `date` and the `payCycleLengthDays`
setting, every time it's needed — nothing cycle-related is written back
to the record. The form only asks for a date; the calculated cycle is
shown next to it as a live, read-only preview.

The calculation (`calculations.js#getCycleForDate`) is a pure function of
`(date, cycleLengthDays, anchor)`:

```
blockIndex = floor((date - anchor) / cycleLengthDays)
cycleStart = anchor + blockIndex * cycleLengthDays
cycleEnd   = cycleStart + cycleLengthDays - 1
```

`anchor` defaults to `DEFAULT_CYCLE_ANCHOR = "1970-01-05"` — a fixed
reference **Monday** (four days after the Unix epoch, which was a
Thursday). Because the anchor is a Monday and both 7 and 14 divide evenly
into a week, this one formula produces:

- **7-day cycles:** the Monday–Sunday week containing the date.
- **14-day cycles:** two consecutive Monday–Sunday weeks, paired
  consistently because they're counted from the same fixed anchor.
- **30-day cycles:** plain 30-day blocks counted from the same anchor —
  not a weekly interpretation, just a deterministic day count.

All arithmetic runs in UTC internally, so daylight-saving clock changes
can never shift a date into the wrong cycle. The same date, cycle length
and anchor always resolve to the same cycle — changing
`payCycleLengthDays` in Settings re-buckets every record's *display*
grouping instantly, without touching a single stored record.

**What happened to the old `cycle` field?** Records created before this
feature may still have a manually-typed `cycle` string (e.g. `"24 Aug –
6 Sep"`). That field is never deleted or rewritten — it's preserved
exactly as-is, but the app stops reading it for grouping, sorting or
totals. If a record's old text no longer matches its freshly computed
cycle, the record row shows a small "Was: *original text*" note so the
history stays visible rather than silently disappearing. New records
never set this field at all.

`dayType` and `paymentType` are stored as the option's **label text**,
not an id. This mirrors the original tracker's behaviour and is what
makes archiving (rather than deleting) safe: a record's stored string
never depends on a settings entry continuing to exist.

## Settings — `localStorage["modern_work_hours_tracker_v1_settings"]`

```jsonc
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "currency": "AUD",            // any ISO 4217 code
  "theme": "system",            // "system" | "light" | "dark"
  "payCycleLengthDays": 14,     // 7 | 14 | 30 — see "Pay cycles (automatic)" above
  "dayTypes": [
    { "id": "day", "label": "Day", "archived": false }
  ],
  "paymentTypes": [
    { "id": "normal", "label": "Normal", "archived": false }
  ],
  "defaults": {
    "dayType": "Day",
    "paymentType": "Normal",
    "startTime": "09:00"
  }
}
```

This key is new. If it doesn't exist (first run, or an upgrade from the
original single-file tracker, which had no settings), it's created with
defaults that match that original tracker's hard-coded lists exactly —
`Day / Afternoon / Night / Overnight` and
`Normal / Overtime / Weekend / Public Holiday / Casual loading` — so an
upgrade changes nothing about what's in the dropdowns until you edit
them yourself.

`storage.js#loadSettings()` merges whatever is stored over the defaults
field-by-field, so a settings object saved by an older version of this
app (missing a field a newer version added) is filled in rather than
rejected.

## If you change the schema

1. Never rename `RECORDS_KEY` in `storage.js`, and never write a shape
   under it that a plain array-of-records reader can't parse.
2. Add new record fields as optional — read with a fallback (see
   `migrateRecord()` in `storage.js`), don't require them.
3. If a field's meaning changes (not just a rename), give `settings`
   (or a new key) a `schemaVersion` bump and write a small migration
   function, the same way `recordMinutes()` already bridges the old
   `workingHours` decimal format.
4. Add a case to the Playwright/manual test that seeds the *old* shape
   in `localStorage` before load, to prove the migration path still
   works — that's how the pay-cycle-ordering and decimal-hours
   compatibility were verified for this version.
